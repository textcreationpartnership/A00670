            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if wee liſten to the Canoniſts, as the Heathen made <hi>Terminus</hi> a God, and ſuch a God that would not yeeld to <hi>Iupiter;</hi> ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt bee the end vnto which all diuiſions in Religion, whereſoeuer diſcuſſed, muſt bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, from whom it is not lawfull to appeale to GOD.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2215:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fathers, and no Lions. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were Nurſing Fathers, now they are Lions, that range alone, that will brooke no equalitie, either with man, or with the world, or with the Scripture, or with any power, but God.</p>
            <p>So though God hath broken downe the wals of the old <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> like the bankes of Paradiſe, and hath let out the riuers of the Church to take their names from the Countreyes through which they paſſe, yet hee hath made incloſure againe, and will haue all to loſe their name in him, as the great Sea.</p>

               <p>I am by Gods prouidence borne and Chriſtned, brought vp and Catechized in the Church of England: The <hi>quaere</hi> is no more but this: Whether I be bound in Conſcience to become a Romiſh Catholique, and to bee reconciled to the preſent Church of Rome, as now it ſtandeth in paine of eternall condemnation?</p>
               <p>This is the very point that draweth ſo many from vs, to whom I propound fiue <hi>Quaeries</hi> or demands, which in the iudgement of indifferent men may ſeeme reaſonable.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, I demand ſome cleere euidence or firm ground to build vpon, that this is my duety, and vpon ſo great a penalty: to thruſt my ſelfe into ſuch an action without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant, I ſhould not onely condemne my ſelfe of raſhneſſe; but incurre offence againſt God in the 14. to the Romanes;<note place="margin">

               <p>The firſt teſtimony that is offered is the Teſtimony of the Church, that is of the Church of Rome, for ſhee tels vs that ſhee alone is the true Catholike Church, out of which there is no ſaluation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followes that ſuch as will be ſaued muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to her: This wee verily beleeue that the Church of Rome ſaith ſo, and hath ſo ſaid a long time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The next <hi>Quaere</hi> is then; whether the Teſtimony of the Church of Rome in this caſe concerning her ſelfe be ſufficient? Go vp as high as they will, ſo long as ſhee hath made this challenge, I demand whether her teſtimony be ſufficient? I anſwer, out of doubt it is not: In the fifth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>If Chriſt ſhould beare witneſſe of himſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.31.</note> 
                  <hi>his witneſſe were not true:</hi> that is, not ſufficient: Though after chap. 8.14. he profeſſes, that though hee ſhould beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2215:13"/>of himſelfe, yet his witnes were true, becauſe ver. 16. <hi>I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me:</hi> Take him ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle as in the firſt place by the way of conceſſion, that he wil deale with the Iewes vpon indifferent termes. I hope then the teſtimony of Chriſt concerning himſelfe, was as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in it ſelfe, and to the Iewes, as the teſtimony of the Church of Rome can be eyther in it ſelfe, or vnto vs. Let it not therefore ſeeme vnreaſonable, if beſide the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church wee deſire further euidence; for heere ſhe ſtandeth for her ſelfe againſt all Churches in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Other teſtimony beſide the Church and Scripture they pretend none, for Traditions are referred to the Church, and the Creeds to the Scripture: To the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then of neceſſity ſhe muſt come in this point.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Our next demand is, whether it is expreſſely there, or drawne out by Tract of conſequent: mentioned it is not, neither in the originall, nor in the vulgar, nor in the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, nor in any of their owne tranſlations.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If by conſequent it bee extracted, my next <hi>Quaere</hi> is; whether I am bound vnder paine of damnation to beleeue euery poynt that may be drawne out of Scripture by conſequence of arguments, wee ſtumble not at immediate conſequents, as ſuch as theſe: The Trinity is not named in ſo many letters; but the Scripture implieth euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be God in ſeuerall places, and elſewhere auerreth that there is but one God: this is eaſily put together: But are wee to beleeue that which by long tract of conſequent may be gathered? Then none but great wits can be ſaued, our weake vnderſtanding is not able to fetch euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the right ground.</p>
               <p>Hence let vs make three degrees of diuine poſitions:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Some are <hi>Articles,</hi> as Chriſt the Sonne of God was crucified.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Some as <hi>Concluſions,</hi> as that children are capable of Baptiſme, but not of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some are taken as <hi>Opinions,</hi> and problemes of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2215:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>As that Angels doe more ſolemnely attend in perſon at holy exerciſes: That Saints ſhall haue ſome perſonall knowledge one of another,<note place="margin">Matt. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had in the mount. Now as fixed ſtarres ſeeme to twinckle, becauſe they are further remote, and cannot ſo ſtedily be diſcerned by our weake eyes: ſo our vnderſtandings are more vnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and our beleefe more vncertaine in points deduced by many ſequels, and farre fetcht conſequents. Theſe bring narrow iſſue, let vs ſee what degree of euidence they bring, and accordingly frame our Faith.</p>
               <q>That I cannot be ſaued except I be ſubiect to the Biſhop of Rome as head of the Church.</q>
               <p>He muſt pretend then a title from Chriſt as he is Vicar: for ſpirituall matters it is euident that Chriſt while he liued on earth, was the viſible head: for Temporalls himſelfe concludes, <hi>Who made me a Iudge? My kingdome is not of this world,</hi> therefore ſo farre as he medleth with kingdomes, he cannot claime that from Chriſt: It is confeſſed, that while Chriſt was on earth, hee was the viſible head of the whole Church, ſo as no ſoule could bee without neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him; but whether at his departure he committed the ſupremacy to any man on earth: If hee did, whether in whole or part: to whom, whether to the Apoſtles in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall equally, or to one aboue the reſt, and who that was?</p>
               <p n="1">1 Their point is, that Chriſt left it to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, &amp; to no other Apoſtle in that degree: This is cleer out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That the reſt of the Apoſtles, as Apoſtles, are equall, but as Biſhop he aboue them: note that, a Biſhop aboue an Apoſtle, <hi>Linus</hi> aboue the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> who liued in his time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Admitte the Supremacy in <hi>Peter,</hi> whether it died with him as the Apoſtleſhip did, or left it to his ſucceſſors:</p>
               <p>The difference is, they put the reſt out of ſpecial fauor, They might haue as great power, but it was for terme of life: <hi>Peter</hi> had it for him, and his ſucceſſors for euer: But this muſt be cleered, that <hi>Peter</hi> had power to leaue it to his ſucceſſors, and none but he. If this be not proued, why not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2215:14"/>
                  <hi>Iohns</hi> ſucceſſors, in the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or of <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or any of the Apoſtles in other places, as well as he to his.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, Though <hi>Peter</hi> by vertue of his fiery tongue, was able to gouerne the whole Church in his daies being but ſmall, yet hee knew the charge in time would grow ſo great, and the circuit ſo large, that <hi>Peters</hi> ſpirit had neede be doubled vpon thoſe that ſhould ſucceed him. If he had one clouen tongue, his ſucceſſors neede to haue twelue: ſo we might ſay of the leaſt of his ſucceſſors, <hi>A greater then Peter is heere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was not alone, during his life, there were the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Bel. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>21</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Paul</hi> as great an Apoſtle as himſelfe as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes, and greater, becauſe hee writ more then <hi>Peter,</hi> hee planted more Churches then <hi>Peter:</hi> he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more aboundantly then they all, for hee preached from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>

                  </note> And that all the charge of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and all that the reſt had, ſhould lye vpon the ſhoulders of one <hi>Pope,</hi> and yet neuer a clouen tongue to his head: Sure ſay <hi>That a greater then Peter is heere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proued well from the election of <hi>Matthias</hi> in the firſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi>

               <p n="3">3 Admit while the body of the Church carried any proportion to a viſible head, as in the Apoſtles time it might, and ſome time after, for auoyding of factions, a Monarchicall gouernment might ſtand, but when it is ſo diſperſed, that amongſt the Antipodes, for ought we know may be Chriſtians, that ſuch a burthen of gouernment ſhould reſt vpon the ſhoulders of any one mortall wight, it is ſtrange.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:2215:14"/>
               <p>It muſt be cleered out of the booke of God, for the Teſtimony of their Church in her owne caſe is ſilent: That <hi>Peter</hi> did not impart his ſupremacy to diuers, in diuers Churches which he planted, but wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to one, in one place.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If to one, we muſt know where that one is, <hi>Certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine fidei,</hi> elſe wee are neuer a whit the neerer. Whether <hi>Peter</hi> left it amongſt the lewes till they fell, being himſelfe the Preacher of the Circumciſion. If not, becauſe hee ſaw they would reuolt, why not at <hi>Antioch,</hi> a Church of his owne planting? <hi>Paul</hi> had as much to doe at <hi>Rome</hi> as he: <hi>Antioch</hi> had the Primacy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.27.</note> for they were firſt called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and it was a famous Patriarchall Church: Why not <hi>Marke</hi> the Euangeliſt, <hi>Peters</hi> Diſciple, who writ the Goſpell from his mouth in that famous Church of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is cleere then that <hi>Rome</hi> and no other <hi>Church</hi> doth enioy that Biſhop who ſucceeds <hi>Peter</hi> in that great office. But now wherein a lay man may receiue ſatisfaction, the Scripture is ſilent: It is not found in our Creede; The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Church is laid by in this point.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> that the Biſhop of Rome alone doth ſucceede <hi>Peter</hi> in the Supremacie, is not found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to be beleeued vpon tradition.

               <p>LEt vs handle this text occaſionally, hauing the laſt Tearme propounded the maine point: The Quere whereupon the reſolution of mindes vnreſolued in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do depend: to wit, whether a man ſtand bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to forſake this preſent Church, in which we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and Catechized to bee reconciled to the Church of Rome vnder paine of eternal condemnation: ſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to their diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning which, I haue made theſe demands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Wee demand ſome cleere euidence for our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, elſe it were not onely raſhneſſe, but a great ſinne in ſo great a matter: that the Church of Rome is the onely Church wherein is ſaluation.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:2215:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2 Whereas to this teſtimony of the Church, that is, of Rome, for other they will acknowledge none, that ſhee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the onely true Catholicke Church, we take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this point to her teſtimony in her owne cauſe: for if Chriſt were content to lay by his teſtimony, let it ſeeme a reaſonable demand.</p>
               <p>If ſhee aske how long we take exception to her teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? we anſwer, iuſt ſo long as ſhe hath made the ſame chal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenge as ſhe doth, and no longer.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Since other teſtimony there is none beſides the Church, and Scripture, which they do pretend. I demand whether this point, that ſhee is the onely Church wherein ſaluation may be found, be there expreſſed, or by tract of conſequent?</p>
               <p>Not expreſſely.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Becauſe a man is not bound to beleeue euery thing, that by conſequent is drawne out of Scripture: I demand ſome cleere conſequent, for according to the degrees of euidence muſt we frame our Faith.</p>
               <p>Now this conſequent is ſo farre fetched, that before they can perſwade a mans conſcience that hee is bound to ioyne with them, and become ſubiect to the Biſhop of that Sea, he muſt of neceſſity demonſtrate theſe 5. points.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That Chriſt beeing the viſible head of his whole Church, ſo as without his Church there was no ſaluation, they muſt proue that he left this to his Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aboue the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That this power giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> did not die with him, as the Apoſtleſhip did with the reſt, but continued in his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That <hi>Peter</hi> at his death did not impart it vnto many after him, though it was a great charge, and like to grow farre greater, but heaped it all vpon one, and that that one was the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That this Biſhop who doth now raigne is not onely lawfully choſen, but doth vndoubtedly ſucceede <hi>Peter</hi> in a direct ſucceſſion for theſe fifteene hundred yeeres, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2215:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>without any materiall interruption.</p>
               <p n="5">5 This proued, wee are neuer the neerer by their owne rule, except it appeare, that this <hi>Pope</hi> and preſent Church of Rome doth ſucceed <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Church, as well in Faith and Doctrine, as place and perſon, for they doe not exclude vs for want of ſucceſſion, our Records are true and cleere; but as heretickes for not obeying their Faith: Therefore if they doe not obey the Faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> all the former points are to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore make a motiue vnto him who is vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his reſolution, that hee would reſt his ſoule where it is, &amp; content himſelfe with the plaine text of Chriſt and his Apoſtles agreed vpon, till theſe fiue points be made cleere to his Conſcience, and before that I hope his ſoule ſhall be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome.</p>

               <p>When I read how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes a Catalogue of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> prerogatiues in eight long Chapters, and in euery one finds a myſtery of ſupremacy: In his name <hi>Cephas,</hi> in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the Sea: In his double draught of fiſh, in his firſt Sermon, and firſt miracle: In <hi>Pauls</hi> reſiſting of him, at Ieruſalem, and the reſt. I ſee a wiſe man may be ouerſeene ſometimes. If arguments went by tale, and not by weight, I could reckon vp <hi>Pauls</hi> praerogatiues, and <hi>Peters</hi> infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would out number <hi>Bellarmines</hi> arguments, but you would deeme me very idle to ſtand vpon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiues were, To be a worthy veſſell, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gods name: That he was firſt in the ranke, where there was a Priority of Order, without ſuperiority of power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was the moſt auncient in yeeres, and one of the moſt familiar with Chriſt, as <hi>Occam</hi> giues the reaſon, but what's this to the purpoſe?</p>
               <p>To ſumme vp the other two famous places of Scripture: For <hi>Orabo pro te, &amp; Confirma fratres:</hi> It is for the daunger, and not the dignitie, and being in the more danger, hee might learne to confirme his brethren in the like: This vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination found to be paſt ouer.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Paſce cues meas:</hi> it is largely demonſtrated in 3. concluſions.</p>
               <p>That it is not ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> as a note of greatneſſe, but as a ſtay of weakeneſſe: 2 That it is no commiſſion, but a command: 3 That therefore the Apoſtles may as well preach to <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> to them by the rule of other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: whence is inferred the iudgement of <hi>Ferus</hi> vpon that Church, an honeſt iudgement of an vſurping Church, notwithſtanding all the prerogatiues of <hi>Peter,</hi> numbred by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> more by tale, then weight, from whence they draw both argument and pretence of their greatneſſe:</p>
               <p>After all the foure olde pillars of Popery are throwne
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2215:23"/>downe by the hands of Fathers and Reaſon: wee haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the two new euaſions of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that by a rule receiued, we prooue that which agrees to one, agrees to all, and that if they were equall in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the people, then equall amongſt themſelues.</p>
               <p>That ſince there was no viſible head for ſixty years, but all Apoſtles were alike: It cannot be, that the dignity of <hi>Peter</hi> can be aboue the reſt, for feare it be prou'd, that the Biſhop of Rome is aboue <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; ſo it ſeemes he is, when his Scarlet Church is about him.</p>
               <p>That being no more out of the worde feeding, but that which is giuen to an ordinary Presbyter in the Acts: By the confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the ſame Epiſcopall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall office, with full iuriſdiction beeing giuen to the reſt of the Apoſtles as well as to <hi>Peter:</hi> The reſt making Biſhops as well as he, and the ſame multitude of ſucceſſors, If not more then he, firſt theſe three iſſues being diſcouered.</p>

               <p>Where note by the way, that the viſible Church of Chriſt from the Aſcenſion into heauen till the death of the Apoſtles, which was aboue ſixty yeares, The Church I ſay had no one viſible head, all the Apoſtles were alike, all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Gouernors, and euer after though the circuit were farre greater, and the people in the Church farre more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, yet it ſhall haue but one to gouerne all, and he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but a ſilly one God wott; yet ſhall his charge bee greater, his dignity more excellent, and his command more abſolute then euer <hi>Peters</hi> was, for <hi>Peter</hi> had many peeres euery whit as good as himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But let vs follow the point: This onely was <hi>Peters</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge aboue his fellowes, That authority which hee had in common with the reſt during their liues, he might as the ordinary Paſtor of the Church conferre it wholly vpon his ſucceſſor of Rome, ſo might no other.</p>

            <p>But the ſeat of God amongſt vs is a mercy ſeat, and his oracles is the comfortable voyce of the Goſpell of Chriſt which defendeth vs and the whole Church: It was the voyce of him that dwelt in the Buſh which preſerued the Buſh from burning, though it was all of a flaming fire: and it is the voyce of the Goſpell of Chriſt which hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this Church from fire and powder. The annoynted therefore as he hath already with his Cherubs quill, ſo let him euer after with both his wings defend, protect, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this Goſpell, ſo long as the heauens couer the earth with his owne wings: they be his, let him then ſuffer none to plucke them, leſt the Church of God bee left naked and vncouered: They be a paire of wings, let him keep them in their due proportion, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> bee brethren, it were vain to contend for ſeniority, who was the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are brethren: <hi>God leadeth his people by the hand of Moſes and Aaron:</hi> If we ſee any one,<note place="margin">

            <p n="4">4 Thus far we haue preſumed to aſcend; yet one ſtep high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er to conclude with the voyce of the author of all: <hi>Ego poſui te,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I haue ſet thee,</hi> that is, I haue made thee a Cherub, with my holy oyle haue I annoynted thee, I haue couered and protected thee in the middeſt of all dangers, to the end that thou might couer and protect my Church: neither is it vnfitly added by the Tranſlater, <hi>I haue ſet thee in Honour,</hi> for there cannot be a greater honor then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Church of Chriſt, nor a more laſting honor for all poſterity, euen 14. generations: I dare be bould to ſay this title of <hi>couering Cherub,</hi> is a more honourable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous title then Prince, King, Emperour, or Monarch of the world.</p>

Adde vnto this his tender loue to his ſmall, weake and diſtreſſed Church, when the faith of his owne Diſciples was going out: I will not beleeue (ſaith one) wee had thought (ſaith another) this had beene hee that ſhould haue redeemed Iſrael: verily it was time to riſe, to ſtrengthen theſe bruiſed reeds, and cheriſh theſe ſmoaking flaxes: vpon the day God was to giue ſentence vpon men for ſinne, hee ſtaid till the heat of the day was ouer, in the third of <hi>Geneſis:</hi>

               <p>Thinke not that that auſtere doctrine of repentance did end with <hi>Iohn Baptiſt;</hi> or that you can baniſh it out of the Citty into the wilderneſſe: for as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did beginne his preaching, <hi>Matthew</hi> the 3.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the generall application or vſe which Chriſt makes of a Parable: a Parable ſtanding betweene two other Parables: The prodigall Son immediately before The rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton following after: This of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt Steward in the middeſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Prodigall</hi> ſpent his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, brought himſelfe into miſery, his miſery brought him to humility, his humility found mercy, becauſe he had a Father.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Rich man</hi> had enough to ſpend, abuſed it, and himſelfe, dropt of a ſudden into hell, where the moſt louing father that euer was had no pitty on him: This is the very frame wherein theſe Parables thus placed by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts were made for our inſtruction, that wee ſhould not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe three which the holy Ghoſt hath ſo ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. When men haue runne themſelues out of breath in wickedneſſe, and wickedneſſe hath brought miſery vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they get this Parable by the end: and while they are in the wine of their vanity, all religion and reſolution is but to make vſe of this one Parable: That when extremity and the feare of death is at hand, then they purpoſe to goe to their Father, and ſay; <hi>Father I haue ſinned againſt heauen and againſt thee,</hi> and thinke the Father muſt needes heare them becauſe of this Parable: Therefore Chriſt annexed this ſecond Parable of the vniuſt Steward, who if hee had ſtayd till miſery had ſeized vpon him, as the Prodigall did, he had been turned out of all, and ſhould haue had neither houſe nor tabernacle wherein to put his head.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> His wiſdome is heere commended vnto vs: That wee would call our ſelues to accompt before hand, take vp his <hi>Quid faciam,</hi> what ſhall I doe?

This is Chriſts aduice. But wee are yet taking of the frame wherein my Text ſtands according to the olde rule, <hi>Vide quid ſupra, vide quid infra.</hi> This Steward for all his wiſdom in one point of wiſdome was defectiue, in that he deferred his reſolution till his Maſter had giuen him warning, <hi>Giue an accompt of thy ſtewardſhip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe" 2.</note> 
               <hi>for thou muſt be no longer Steward:</hi> for if wee deferre our reckoning till ſickneſſe, or ſome other Meſſenger of death arreſt vs, it may be we ſhall want either <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> to prouide for our ſoules: Therefore followes the third Parable of <hi>one that fared deliciouſty euery day:</hi> had no admonition before,<note place="margin">Verſe 19.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſery to bring him home, nor warning to prepare himſelfe, but died ſuddenly and went to the Diuell: feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full examples wee haue euery yeere, of ſome that are ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched away by ſudden death, <hi>Qui in momento deſcendunt in Infernum,</hi> take the eaſieſt tranſlation, which in a moment doe deſcend downe into the graue: Thus is the King of Heauen, a Father to one, a Maſter to another, but a iuſt Iudge to the third. To the penitent Conuerts a louing &amp; mercifull father, as to the prodigall Sonne, more ready to receiue vs then we to offer our ſelues, <hi>Ile goe to my Father,</hi> ſayes the Sonne, <hi>the Father ranne to meet him,</hi> the young man goes, the olde man runnes; <hi>runnes and fals vpon his necke and kiſſes him.</hi> But if this tenderly and fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be abuſed, and ouermuch preſumed on, then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parable makes him a Maſter that will call vs roundly to accompt, and bid vs giue ouer our Stewardſhips: and if the ſeruant of that Maſter deferre, will not beleeue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, but ſay his Maſter will bee long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2215:76"/>then the Maſter of that ſeruant ſhall come <hi>in an houre,</hi> when he lookes not, and giue him his portion with the rich Glutton and Hypocrites. Therefore it is good to bee wiſe in time, and rather then faile, to learne wiſdome from the <hi>children of this world,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It was none of the honeſteſt reſolution this Steward made, though the wiſeſt: when he had ſpent all, he was too idle to worke, <hi>fodere neſcio,</hi> I cannot digge, I was neuer brought vp to take paines; hee was too proud to beg, <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare erubeſco,</hi> I that haue liued ſo gallantly amongſt my companions am aſhamed to begge, ſo in the end hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues to rob his Maſter: a wicked reſolution, yet out of this wickedneſſe doth Chriſt teach vs to extract wiſdome.</p>

But we muſt make ſuch friends as will bee ſure to helpe when wee ſhall want, ſuch as ſhall bee both willing and able to helpe: where ſhall wee

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note> Chriſt who is the <hi>Word it ſelfe</hi> makes it plain: <hi>The friends</hi> he would commend vnto vs are poore and needy, if wee can bribe thoſe well, they will ſtand vs in better ſteede in the time of need, then all Iudges and Princes of the world: Poore and needy? alas theſe are but poore friends: This ſeemed ſuch a Paradox to the Phariſies when Chriſt ſpake it, that they mocked: whoſe laughter, as I take it, was the occaſion of the third Parable: Doe yee thinke it bootleſſe to make the poore your friends? There was a rich man in ſcarlet, a begger at his gate, had not hee better haue made this begger his friend, a few crummes would haue done it in time, hee neglected this, therefore when hee wanted a drop of water, hee could not obtaine it: not becauſe the poore are able of themſelues to bee friends, but God doth vndertake for them, hee hath giuen his word for euery worke of charity, whether it be a worke of Piety or of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of Piety to his Church, or of Mercy to the miſerable, we haue bountifull rewards promiſed for both.</p>

            <p>Its a worke of piety well begun in this place: Was it not pitty that the poore ſchollers ſhould be fetcht from the Vniuerſities vpon bare exhibitions? That Miniſters ſhould be called out of the Countrey from ſuch poore ſingle Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices to feed your ſoules, and haue no more refreſhing for their paines, but a poore dinner? Its remembred that ſome haue come aboue forty miles on foot to furniſh this place, yet could they not ſay, <hi>Quam ſpecioſi,</hi> but <hi>quam lutoſi ſunt pedes Euangelizantium:</hi> Should themſelues haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained who were aſhamed to be ſo knowen? then it would be ſayd, we begge for our ſelues: Thankes be to God, the world is ſomewhat amended in this, I would it were ſo in the reſt: Its no ſmall encouragement that what good ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee doe, whether it bee by workes of Piety to the Church, or of mercy to the miſerable, ſhall not goe vnre warded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Get you friends</hi>] but what is the way to make them ſure friends? the ſhauing of the head and paring of the nailes? I may ſay with the Poet.</p>

God forbid: yet one caſe there is I confeſſe where ill-gotten goods muſt be beſtowed vpon good vſes of neceſſity, elſe they will beſtow our ſoules in hell fire: Its but one caſe, and I feare that it is the caſe of many in theſe dayes, who poſſeſſe much wealth ill-gotten, who haue deceiued ſo many by bargaine and ſale, oppreſſed ſo many by their place and office, receiued ſo many fees either for ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or doing no hurt, as the Diuell takes gifts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians <hi>ne noceat,</hi> ſo much wealth haue they gotten wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they know not the right owners, nor where to find them. In this caſe they muſt be their Executors to beſtow them as themſelues would, or rather ſhould to godly vſes. For thy conſcience tels thee, the owners of theſe goods, would not willingly bequeath them to thee nor thine, thou knoweſt neither them nor theirs: then it followes as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayes, <hi>Acquiſiſti malè, impende iam benè:</hi> whoſoeuer oweth them, thou art not the right owner, therfore as long as thou keepeſt them, thou keepeſt the curſe of God with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 3 14.

            <p>This doctrine is moſt true, but it is not the meaning of this Parable: <hi>Restitution</hi> is an act of Iuſtice, but my Text intends Charity: If the Steward had giuen the Debters no more corne and oyle then their due, they would neuer haue receiued him into their houſes, but it was out of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liberality more then hee ought them, therefore of free liberality is this vnderſtood: for the more eaſie paſſage <hi>Beza</hi> reades it <hi>ex Mammona fallaci,</hi> of deceitfull or vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
